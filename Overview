This Project is about prediction of migraine using machine learning algorithms. The resarch code aims for grater accuracy levels of predicction. Hence main algorithm Random Forest is compared to other 
four best performing algorithms.

Data Set used for analysis is collected form kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranzeet013/migraine-dataset
